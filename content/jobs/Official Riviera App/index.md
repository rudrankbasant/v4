- Single-handedly made an app using Flutter and Dart for VITâ€™s biggest cultural and sports event, with currently over 8000+ users.
- You can download the Android app [by clicking here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.ac.vit.riviera23) or the iOS app [ from here](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/riviera-23/id1665459606).
- The app displays information like announcements, location, schedule, merch and a photo feed along with a notification system using which the user can get notified about specific events that they have liked.
- The app implements the Bloc/Cubit architecture for state management and uses the Repository pattern for data management, and makes calls from Firebase as well as the backend API.
- Considering the limited amount of reads from Firebase, the app has a system of caching the data so that the user can access the data even when they are offline, and the data is updated only when we allow it to be updated, hence removing unnecessary calls.
